# Substake: Cross-chain Liquid Staking Solution

Substake is a revolutionary Cross-chain Liquid Staking solution designed to empower users to participate in liquid staking from Layer 2 (L2) funds. By leveraging Substake, users can deposit their wrapped tokens on L2, which our platform seamlessly bridges to Layer 1 (L1) for staking on Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) platforms such as Lido, Rocket Pool, and Stader Labs. Our solution is highly gas-effective, minimizing the bridging and staking costs for users.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Cross-chain Staking**: Deposit wrapped tokens on L2, bridge them to L1, and stake on LSD platforms without the hassle of managing different chains individually.

- **Gas Efficiency**: Substake significantly reduces gas fees by creating batches on L2s and equally distributing the bridging and staking costs among batch members.

- **APY Generation**: Users can enjoy a regular Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on their L2 funds without the complexities associated with traditional staking processes.

## Stake Flow

1. **Deposit and SubToken Creation**: Users deposit their funds on our platform and receive SubToken, a representational token. These deposited funds are accumulated in a batch, and when specific conditions are met, the batch is dispatched to L1.

2. **Bridging and Staking on LSD Platforms**: After the bridging of tokens to L1, they are staked on LSD platforms, providing users with a regular APY. Transaction costs are efficiently partitioned among batch members, ensuring gas efficiency.

3. **Native Token Unstaking**: Substake also facilitates the unstaking of native tokens in a similar fashion. Users deposit their Subtokens, a batch is created, and after meeting specific conditions, the batch is dispatched. The wstETH is then swapped for wETH and transferred to L2 for distribution.

## Benefits

- **Gas Cost Reduction**: Substake minimizes gas fees associated with bridging and staking, making liquid staking more accessible and cost-effective for users.

- **Efficient APY Generation**: Users can generate a regular APY on their L2 funds without the complexities and high costs typically associated with staking on multiple chains.

- **Streamlined Process**: The protocol streamlines the staking and unstaking processes, providing users with a hassle-free experience while maximizing efficiency.

Substake is your gateway to a gas-efficient, cross-chain liquid staking experience, allowing you to maximize the potential of your L2 funds without the usual hassles. Join us in revolutionizing the staking landscape.
